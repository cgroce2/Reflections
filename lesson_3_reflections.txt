When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: When you have created a branch and are ready to start pushing small changes to your branch, creating a commit history rather than keeping everything local.  Also if you were ready to share the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: Because accepting changes from the remote when you are ready allows you to keep working on your version without worrying about potential breaking changes coming down from the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer: A branch can be only on one repo, usually your own local.  A clone is when you want to clone a repo to your machine.  A Fork is when you want to fork a repo on Github to your Github account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Answer: So you can see the state either at the time of branching, or the changes since you branched.
